# DOWNSTREAM-OVERRIDES

Meta guidance for maintainers defining how downstream-project extensions should
be authored by AI agents.

## Scope
- Applies only to this repository.
- Do not copy these rules verbatim into downstream-projects.

## Path Model
- Use placeholders in guidance and templates:
  - `<AI_ROOT_PATH>`
  - `<AI_RULES_PATH>`
  - `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>`
- Default mapping:
  - `<AI_ROOT_PATH>=ai`
  - `<AI_RULES_PATH>=<AI_ROOT_PATH>/AI-RULES`
  - `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>=<AI_ROOT_PATH>/PROJECT`
- Never hardcode `ai` when placeholders are available.

## Extension Semantics and Conflict Precedence
- Baseline rules under `<AI_RULES_PATH>` remain authoritative defaults.
- Downstream files under `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>` extend baseline rules.
- Default conflict behavior: downstream extension takes precedence.
- Exception: baseline wins only when a baseline rule explicitly marks itself as
  non-extensible (non-overridable).
- Missing downstream extension content always falls back to baseline behavior.

## File Placement Rules
- Extend baseline topics at the same relative path under
  `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>` where appropriate.
- Materialize only files and directories that are actually extended or added.
- Avoid copying untouched baseline files into `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>`.
- Downstream-projects may add additional directories/files not present in
  baseline for project-specific guidance not covered by baseline.

## Link and Index Rules
- Downstream extension entry point is `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>/AI.md`.
- Every Markdown file under `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>` must be transitively reachable
  from `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>/AI.md`.
- While building link chains, mirror baseline structure where appropriate.
- Additional downstream-only files must also be included in the same reachable
  index chain.
- Maintain index hygiene consistently:
  - Keep clear index files for directories with multiple children.
  - Keep links updated whenever files move or new files are added.

## Reachability Verification (Docs-Only, Deterministic)
Use this procedure whenever downstream extension files are added or moved,
operating on the downstream-project's vendored copy of `AI-RULES` and its
resolved `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>`:
1. Build `IN_SCOPE`:
   - Include all `*.md` files under `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>`.
   - Normalize each path to a repo-relative path and sort alphabetically.
2. Build `REACHABLE`:
   - Start with `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>/AI.md`.
   - Traverse markdown links recursively from each newly discovered file:
     - Treat links as non-image inline markdown links in the form
       `[text](target)`.
     - Ignore image links in the form `![alt](target)`.
     - Ignore external URL targets (for example `http:`, `https:`,
       `mailto:`, or targets starting with `//`).
     - Ignore empty targets and pure fragment targets (for example
       `""` or `#section`).
     - For `path#fragment`, strip `#fragment` and resolve only `path`.
     - Resolve paths relative to the link source file directory and normalize
       `.` and `..` segments.
   - Include only resolved targets that are markdown files under
     `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>`.
   - Normalize each included path to repo-relative form with `/` separators and
     de-duplicate paths while traversing.
3. Compare sets:
   - Pass: `IN_SCOPE - REACHABLE` is empty.
   - Fail: `IN_SCOPE - REACHABLE` contains at least one file.
4. On failure:
   - Add or fix index/parent links for each missing file.
   - Re-run the same procedure until `IN_SCOPE - REACHABLE` is empty.

## Authoring Workflow for AI Agents
1. Resolve placeholders from the target downstream-project configuration.
2. Decide whether the new rule is:
   - an extension of an existing baseline topic, or
   - a new downstream-specific topic or rule not present in baseline.
3. Create/update files under `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>` using placement rules above.
4. Update index and parent-link chains so every touched file is reachable from
   `<AI_PROJECT_PATH>/AI.md`.
5. Verify precedence notes are not contradicting non-overridable baseline
   constraints.
6. Validate links and structure before finalizing changes.
